This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It uses Next.js 13 and TypeScript. The front-end uses Tailwind and back-end uses Python.

## Tech stack
Front-end: Next.js 13, TypeScript
Back-end: Python

## Objective
Learn or use as a starter template a simple web application which integrates two different technologies - Next.js and Python.

## Functionality
This is a simple application that takes two numbers as input via text fields, multiplies both and shows the result in a "Total" textfield. The calculation is triggered using a "Calculate" button.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
